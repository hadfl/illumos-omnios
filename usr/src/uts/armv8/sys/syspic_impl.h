/*
 * System Programmable Interrupt Controller interfaces
 *
 * Interfaces to register a system PIC and dispatch calls to it.
 *
 * The `syspic' facility provides a layer between `intr.c' (handling hardware
 * interrupts delivered to the Arm CPU) and a system interrupt controller
 * driver (typically an Arm Generic Interrupt Controller). The subsystem and
 * system interrupt controller driver cooperate to expose interrupt state
 * tracking information to debuggers.
 *
 * The syspic facility is initialised during system startup. Initialisation
 * simply initialises data structures and mutexes.
 *
 * When acting as the root of the interrupt hierarchy, an interrupt controller
 * driver registers a set of interrupt operations with syspic along with a
 * context pointer (typically the driver's soft state or dip). When a hardware
 * interrupt is received and dispatched via `do_interrupt' several interrupt
 * management calls are made through `syspic', which calls the appropriate
 * registered operation, adding the registered context pointer.
 *
 * As interrupts are registered, the driver cooperates with `syspic' to track
 * information about the interrupts in a way that can be inspected by `mdb'.
 * This tracking takes two paths. The first handles standard DDI interrupts -
 * those enabled via the `DDI_INTROP_ENABLE' call. The driver uses the
 * `syspic_get_state' function to obtain a state pointer for the interrupt
 * vector, locking the interrupt tracking structures. The driver then fills
 * in the sense and priority for the interrupt before calling `add_avintr'
 * with the `syspic_intrs_lock' mutex locked. Finally, the driver releases the
 * `syspic_intrs_lock' mutex. The second case handles inter-processor
 * interrupts (called SGIs in Arm terminology). In the case of SGIs, DDI is not
 * involved, so the `addspl' function in the driver must recognise SGIs, create
 * the state object via a call to `syspic_get_state', record the interrupt
 * configuration (SGIs can only be edge triggered) and unlock the mutex when
 * done.
 *
 * When interrupts are disabled the driver should lock the `syspic_intrs_lock'
 * mutex in the `delspl' function, remove state tracking using
 * `syspic_remove_state', program the hardware, and then unlock
 * `syspic_intrs_lock' before returning.
 *
 * The Interrupt Operations
 *
 * The four callers of `syspic' functionality are: CPU startup, IPIs,
 * auto-vectored interrupt management and hardware interrupt handling.
 *
 * The unix startup code calls `syspic_cpu_init' during CPU startup, which
 * calls the `spo_cpu_init' operation against the registered system PIC.
 *
 * Inter-processor interrupts are invoked by `unix' and calls are made to one
 * of three syspic functions (based solely on what's most ergonomic for the
 * callsite): `syspic_send_ipi' (delivers to a cpuset); `syspic_send_ipi_one'
 * (delivers to a CPU object) and `syspic_send_ipi_one_id' (delivers to a CPU
 * ID).
 *
 * The auto-vectored interrupts functionality (via `add_avintr' and
 * `rem_avintr') results in calls to `addspl' and `delspl', which point to
 * `syspic_addspl' and `syspic_delspl' respectively (these names are not
 * visible). These functions then call through to the `spo_addspl' and
 * `spo_addspl' operations, passing the driver context.
 *
 * The remaining operations are called during interrupt processing and are
 * individually documented in `sys/syspic.h'. The programming model reflects
 * Arm's split-EOI model, where the `end-of-interrupt' call becomes a priority
 * drop, and the `deactivate' call returns the interrupt to the inactive or
 * pending state.
 *
 * In all cases, the `syspic' functionality deals with what Arm calls an INTID,
 * which is a flat interrupt ID namespace. Any firmware-specific notion of
 * interrupt identification must be resolved into INTID identifiers prior to
 * calling the `syspic' interfaces.
