/*
 * XXXPCI: On ARM we have basically two universes, SBSA and Not.  In the SBSA
 * world this can be ACPI based, and I think only ECAM is relevant
 *
 * In the non-BSA world this can be a lot.  We may have multiple PCIe root
 * complexes in the devicetree, each with its own space, and in theory at
 * least, its own configuration space access mechanism
 *
 * These devices may or may not (further) have been partially (or perhaps
 * fully) enumerated either by firmmware, or statically.
 *
 * The current PCI prototype makes a simplifying assumption:
 *
 * - There is only one PCIe root complex in the devicetree, it is at "/pcie"
 *   (this is generally false, but convenient to bootstrap)
